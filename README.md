# Text-Mining-NLP-projects

In the first project I have explored cleaning and processing reuters data and doing supervised sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine algorithms
- Python nltk, wordcloud, sklearn modules used

In the second project I have worked on tweets surrounding Apple, Tesla, Netflix by unique normal users and getting topic relations and user sentiment using word embeddings and 
- topic modeling - Python nltk, gensim, wordcloud modules used

Cleaning and processing required stemming, lemmatizing, taking out punctuations, stopwords, urltags and others as data required.
